<h1>TalkHQ Mobile App</h1>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<p>React Native, Expo Go, Express.JS, PostgreSQL</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The TalkHQ Mobile Application was developed in conjunction with two other team members as part of a work integrated learning project at university. My role in this team was the front-end developer. We designed, created, and published a mobile application for the TalkHQ Speech Pathology located in Cairns Australia. This included weekly meetings with the client to ensure we meet their requirements for the application. The mobile application demographic is the parent/carer of a client of the practice, whether that be a past, present, or prospective client. Once creating an account within the app, providing information of first and last names, setting a password, and providing the date-of-birth of the child/children, the app will provide a home feed of relevant resources for the client, based on the date-of-birth. A resource feed will also be provided, where the user can peruse all resources on the app, and a community chatroom can also be accessed. This application is to be downloadable from the relevant mobile app store and stylistically match Talk HQâ€™s existing branding and website style.</p>
